  Thanks for joining our Reinforcement Learning Specialization! We're excited to have you start, but before you do, read through the following pre-requisites and learning objectives, to ensure you get the most out of the course:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What do I need to know before starting this course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is important to note that this specialization will
  <strong>
   not
  </strong>
  cover any programming; there are no lectures on python. To be comfortable with the course content, students should have at least a university level course in python, or one year experience, before starting course 1. Learners should be comfortable converting algorithms written in english in code. If your python's a bit rusty, don't worry! Why not have a go at the University of Alberta's introductory Python course:
  <a href="https://coursera.org/learn/problem-solving-programming-video-games" title="Problem Solving, Programming and Video Games">
   Problem Solving, Programming and Video Games
  </a>
  and refresh your coding skills!
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll also need some basic math knowledge including, basic knowledge and comfort with expected values, distributions, and sampling, as well as basic calculus (derivatives), linear algebra (vectors, matrices, inner products), functions.
 </p>

   What will I learn from the course?
