  Thanks for joining the third course in our Reinforcement Learning Specialization! We're excited to have you start, but before you do, read through the following pre-requisites and learning objectives, to ensure you get the most out of the course:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What do I need to know before starting this course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is highly recommended that students complete
  <a href="https://coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning" title="Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning">
   Course 1: Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning
  </a>
  and
  <a href="https://coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods" title="Course 2: Sample Based Learning Methods">
   Course 2: Sample-Based Learning Methods
  </a>
  before starting Prediction and Control with Function Approximation. It is also important to note that this specialization will
  <strong>
   not
  </strong>
  cover any programming; there are no lectures on python. To be comfortable with the course content, students should have at least a university level course in python, or one year experience, before starting any of the courses in this specialization. Learners should be comfortable converting algorithms written in english in code. If your python's a bit rusty, don't worry! Why not have a go at the University of Alberta's introductory Python course:
  <a href="https://coursera.org/learn/problem-solving-programming-video-games" title="Problem Solving, Programming and Video Games">
   Problem Solving, Python Programming and Video Games
  </a>
  and refresh your coding skills!
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll also need some basic math knowledge including, basic knowledge and comfort with expected values, distributions, and sampling, as well as basic calculus (derivatives), linear algebra (vectors, matrices, inner products), functions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What will I learn from the course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In the attached PDF, you can read the module-by-module learning objectives for Course Three: Prediction and Control with Function Approximation.  Tick off each learning objective as you go through the course!
