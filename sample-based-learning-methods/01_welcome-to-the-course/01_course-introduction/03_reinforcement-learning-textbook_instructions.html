  Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto, is essential reading for anyone wishing to learn the theory and practice of modern Reinforcement learning. "When I teach RL at the University of Alberta" , says Adam White, "one of my primary objectives is to get the students to read the RL textbook. The students that read before lecture consistently track the material better, and perform much better in the course."

 <p>
  The readings selected for the RL specialization are very selective, and it is important to make your weekly readings an integral part of your commitment. The video lectures, quizzes, and notebooks were designed assuming the learner has read the relevant passages in the book.

  Sutton and Barto's book is the most cited publication in RL research, and is responsible for making RL accessible to people around the world. The new edition, released in 2018, offers improved notation and explanations, additional algorithms, advanced topics, and many new examples; and it's totally free...here you go!
